NOTES:

These are pretty lossy but not extremely so.  Double the texture size and repaint
if you want higher detail.

Four basic shapes are included in this package, each textured to two different,
one-sided liveries, for a total of eight different box trailers.

A limited 512 x 512 px 'paint-kit' file is included, with some free space if you want
to have double-sided vertical stab markings.

Each object is split into two LOD groups: Main trailer boxes appear at less than
1.5kms, with more detailed objects appearing at less than 500 meters.

Each object comes with the TILTED command but not set for any angle limit.


INSTRUCTIONS:

Drop the 'trailers' folder or any objects and two texture files (.png and .dds) into
your scenery's 'objects' folder.  Place each box trailer in your scenery using WED
or Overlay Editor.
